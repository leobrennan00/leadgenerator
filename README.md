I was embarking on a new project that could assist local businesses in Ireland in any day to day tasks they might find tedious or time consuming that could be easily automated. I know that people in these labour intensive professions dont have the time to research how to make these processes easier or faster. A lot of these jobs dont require much technological use which also means they might not be aware of what can be done to make these tasks more efficient using up to date tech. My first objective was to collect data from business owners around the country who work in a particular profession. 

I knew that most business owners might see an email inquiring about their day to day admin work and ignore it so i developed an app that could search for these businesses given a location, radius of search, and a business type. This app would then display the details of the businesses found within a radius(name, phone, address, website, email), if an email was not visible in the initial search the app would then webscrape the website of the business and store the email found on the website within a database.

I then implemented a way to send bulk emails to a specific business type so that I could tailor the email to ask questions specific to that profession. The technologies used are Django, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, SQL, Google Places API, Beautiful Soup.
